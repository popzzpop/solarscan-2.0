# Security Documentation

## Security Measures Implemented

### 🔒 **Authentication & Rate Limiting**

1. **Email Rate Limiting**
   - 3 email submissions per 5 minutes per client
   - Client fingerprinting based on browser characteristics
   - Automatic blocking with clear error messages

2. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Search queries: 30 per minute
   - General API calls: 100 per minute
   - Graceful degradation when limits exceeded

### 🛡️ **Input Validation & Sanitization**

1. **Contact Form Validation**
   - Email format validation (RFC compliant)
   - Phone number validation (international formats)
   - Input length restrictions (max 500 characters)
   - XSS prevention through sanitization

2. **Data Sanitization**
   - Automatic removal of `<>\"'` characters
   - Structured data validation for lead capture
   - Monthly bill validation (0-10,000 range)

### 🔐 **Content Security Policy (CSP)**

Implemented strict CSP headers:
- `default-src 'self'` - Only allow same-origin by default
- `script-src` - Google Maps, EmailJS only
- `img-src` - Google Maps images and data URIs only
- `connect-src` - Solar API and EmailJS endpoints only

### 🚫 **Security Headers**

- **X-Frame-Options: DENY** - Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Prevents MIME sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin** - Limits referrer info

### 📊 **Data Protection**

1. **LocalStorage Encryption** (Recommended for future)
   - Currently stores lead data unencrypted
   - Consider implementing encryption for sensitive data

2. **Secure Lead Handling**
   - All lead data is sanitized before processing
   - Backup storage in localStorage if email fails
   - No sensitive data in console logs (truncated)

### 🔑 **API Key Security**

1. **Environment Variables**
   - All API keys stored in `.env` file
   - `.env` file properly gitignored
   - Use of VITE_ prefix for client-side variables

2. **Google Maps API**
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Add domain restrictions in Google Cloud Console
   - Restrict to production domain before deployment
   - Consider IP restrictions for additional security

3. **EmailJS Configuration**
   - Public key (meant to be client-side exposed)
   - Rate limiting should be configured in EmailJS dashboard

### 📦 **Dependency Security**

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Regular `npm audit` checks
   - Automated dependency updates
   - Currently: 12 vulnerabilities remaining (mostly dev dependencies)

2. **Critical Updates Applied**
   - Updated 77 packages
   - Resolved most high/critical vulnerabilities
   - Some breaking changes avoided (SvelteKit, Vite)

## 🚨 **Security Checklist for Production**

### Before Deployment:

- [ ] **Generate new API keys** (current ones exposed in git history)
- [ ] **Add domain restrictions** to Google Maps API key
- [ ] **Configure rate limits** in EmailJS dashboard  
- [ ] **Remove .env from git history** using BFG or git-filter-branch
- [ ] **Test all security measures** in staging environment
- [ ] **Run final vulnerability scan** with `npm audit`
- [ ] **Configure HTTPS** with proper SSL certificates
- [ ] **Add monitoring** for security events and rate limit violations

### Post-Deployment Monitoring:

- [ ] Monitor localStorage usage for lead data accumulation
- [ ] Watch for CSP violations in browser console
- [ ] Track rate limit violations and abuse patterns
- [ ] Regular security updates for dependencies

## 🔧 **Security Configuration Files**

1. **`src/lib/security.ts`** - Rate limiting, validation, CSP headers
2. **`src/app.html`** - Meta security headers, CSP policy
3. **`src/lib/emailService.ts`** - Secure email handling with validation

## 🚨 **Known Security Considerations**

1. **Client-Side API Keys**
   - Google Maps API key is necessarily exposed (client-side requirement)
   - Mitigated by domain/referrer restrictions (MUST be configured)

2. **LocalStorage Data**
   - Lead data stored unencrypted in browser
   - Consider encryption for sensitive information
   - Data persists until manually cleared

3. **EmailJS Exposure**
   - Service configuration partially exposed (by design)
   - Rate limiting must be configured on EmailJS platform

## 📞 **Security Contact**

For security concerns or vulnerability reports:
- Review this documentation
- Test in development environment first
